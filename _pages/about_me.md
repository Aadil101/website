Hi there! 👋

My name is Aadil. People often seem to improv the pronunciation of my name. Here are some of my favorites, please take your pick:

- A-dhil 
- A-dil pickle 🥒
- A-deal the real deal 🏆
- A-dale ❓

# Summary

I'm an aspiring data scientist currently finishing up my undergrad. This fall, I'm hoping to begin my masters 🎓 I hope this site gives you a taste of my passions in statistics and computer science 😊 My interests in applied machine learning largely pertain to natural language processing (eg. lexical complexity prediction & anomalous text detection) 💻 

# Education

I'm a senior at Dartmouth College (hoping to graduate in Spring 2021) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics 🌲

# Experience

I've been fortunate to have had internship experiences where I worked on:

- A fully unsupervised anomalous document detection pipeline 🎯
- A document classification pipeline 📄
- Designing novel face-clustering algorithms 😎
- Improving personnel-vehicle object detection models 🚗 🚶🏽‍♂️
