Hi there! 👋

My name is Aadil. People often improv the pronunciation of my name, so take your pick from some of my favorites:

- A-dhil 
- Croc-adilean 🐊
- A-dil pickle 🥒
- A-dale ❓
- A-deal the real deal 🏆

## Summary

I'm an aspiring data scientist, and I hope this website gives you a taste of my passions in statistics and computer science. My interests lie across applied machine learning, particularly within _natural language processing_ and _computer vision_.

## Education

I graduated from Dartmouth College (Class of '21) majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Statistics 🌲 I'm returning there this fall to pursue my Master's in Computer Science 🎓

## Experience

I've been fortunate to have had internship experiences where I worked on:

- Teaching high school students foundations of artificial intelligence and machine learning 🤖
- A fully unsupervised anomalous document detection pipeline 🎯
- A document classification pipeline 📄
- Designing novel face-clustering algorithms 😎
- Improving personnel-vehicle object detection models 🚗 🚶🏽‍♂️
