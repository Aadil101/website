Hi there! 👋

My name is Aadil. People often seem to improv the pronunciation of my name. Here are some of my favorites, so take your pick:

- A-dhil 
- A-dil pickle 🥒
- A-deal the real deal 🏆
- A-dale ❓

I'm an aspiring data scientist currently finishing up my undergrad 🎓. This fall, I'm hoping to begin my masters. I hope this site gives you taste of my passions in statistics and computer science 😊.
