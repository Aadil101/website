Hi there! 👋

My name is Aadil. People often seem to improv the pronunciation of my name. Here are some of my favorites, please take your pick:

- A-dhil 
- A-dil pickle 🥒
- A-deal the real deal 🏆
- A-dale ❓

# In Short

I'm an aspiring data scientist currently finishing up my undergrad 🎓 This fall, I'm hoping to begin my masters. I hope this site gives you a taste of my passions in statistics and computer science 😊

My interests in applied machine learning largely pertain to natural language processing (eg. lexical complexity prediction & anomalous text detection) 💻 I've been fortunate to have had internship experiences where I applied face clustering algorithms and improved object detection models.
